Home Grown Yoga started at the beginning of Covid when Meghann realized she needed a way to teach people yoga, but still keep them safe.  It began with a private yoga group and has now grown into private zoom classes, small (safe) group classes, thai yoga, meditation - whatever you need to enjoy yoga. Kristyn, Sarah, and Megan also make up the rest of the instructors to HGY and are located all over the country.  We are here to help you learn yoga in whatever ways you might need.
